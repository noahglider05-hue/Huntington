Time series analysis uses past data to identify trend, seasonality, cycical variations, and irregularities (noise).
As it pertains to this project, we are most intrested in seasonality macro trends. 

It answers the question of "can we gain insight (predict) what will happen in the future given the past"
    - Do months vs quarters behave differently
    - Is there seasonality? Does it align with business cycle? Compare to NASDQ
    - 





To start, we will map quarerly closing price of XLE (energy) and Oil prices (MCOILWTICO) in simpleTimeSeries.py
