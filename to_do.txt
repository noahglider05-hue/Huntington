AI summary
    We are building a linear regression model to predict the monthly closing price of the XLE energy ETF using macroeconomic variables (PCEPI, GDP, UNRATE, FEDFUNDS, MCOILWTICO). Data is processed via a configurable pipeline (master_table) that handles reading, optional interpolation, MoM % changes, and per-variable lags. Regression predictors are aligned after shifting, and performance is evaluated with MSE and R². Key observations: applying MoM or excessive lags can worsen performance, WTI (MCOILWTICO) intuitively should be predictive but its effect is dampened by scaling, MoM, and multicollinearity, and small lags (0–1 months) plus proper scaling generally give more stable models.
