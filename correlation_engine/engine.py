This file works as the main.py file for the correlation engine

Engine Inputs:
    1) Master_table --> Observation_date as index (interpolated monthly), all macro variables, all etf tickers
    2) Range of lags --> (-12 to 12) totaling 25 total lags
    3) List of all macro variables; will be important for separating the master_table
    4) List of all etf tickers; will be important for separating the master_table
    5) The window size for chunking, allows use to try different windows to test for differences can test (3 years, 5 years, 7 years, etc)
